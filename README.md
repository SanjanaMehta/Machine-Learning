# Machine-Learning
Compilation of my learnings of Machine Learning models in Python
## Contents:
### 1. Simple Linear Regression 
https://github.com/SanjanaMehta/Machine-Learning/blob/main/simple%20linear%20reg.py#L4
### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
### 3. Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, and Model training of these.
ðŸ§¹ Ridge lasso.py - Data Cleaning & EDA
Tasks performed:
- Removed missing and erroneous rows.
- Converted data types appropriately (e.g., int, float).
- Generated visualizations:
- Correlation heatmap
- Pairplots
- Boxplots

ðŸ¤– Model Training.py - Model Building & Evaluation
Models Built:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression (with LassoCV for hyperparameter tuning)
- Ridge Regression (with RidgeCV for hyperparameter tuning)
- ElasticNet (with ElasticNetCV for hyperparameter tuning)

Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- All models are visualized using scatter plots (Actual vs Predicted)
